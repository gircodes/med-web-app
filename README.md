## About the 'MEDICAL WEB APP'

---

The 'Virtual Health Care' web app helps patients to meet their doctors from their homes. 

They can primarily book an appointment starting from the next day and within a fortnight (14 days). The doctor 'approves' it before the day ends, else suggests the patient to reschedule. 

The doctor generates a zoom call link 15 mins prior to the scheduled appointment time, and updates the 'Patient Call Link'. The patient uses that link to connect with the doctor.

The doctor examines the patient through the 'video call' and prescribes medications and further course of action.

The app is built using MERN stack, with react js as the frontend and mongoose with node js as the backend. The data is saved in MongoDB Atlas.
